# Stimulus and figure generation for a probe-rhythm study

This repository holds support materials for [a psychological study][Hadrava2016] authored by me and my friend and colleague [Štěpán Bahník][bahniks]. You will find two command-line utilities here: [one for generating polyrhythms from musical chords][probe-rhythm-stimuli] and [another one for visualising oscillations][probe-rhythm-figures]. Note that the former wasn't actually used for synthesizing the stimuli for our study. Instead, we used an [IHaskell][IHaskell] notebook which, together with the stimuli, can be downloaded from [here][stimuli]. The command-line utility is provided merely for convenience.
