# Stimulus and figure generation for a probe-rhythm study

This repository holds support materials for [a psychological study][Hadrava2016] authored by me and my friend and colleague [Štěpán Bahník][bahniks]. You will find two command-line utilities here: [one for generating polyrhythms from musical chords][probe-rhythm-stimuli] and [another one for visualising oscillations][probe-rhythm-figures].
